In this project, I wrote a Python script that presents a fun fact and some background information about me.

**Name:** Eric Opoku

**What I know about myself**

I enjoy teaching kids and mentoring, and I love writing about nature in poems and prose while listening to classical and hymn music. Hiking is one of my favorite activities because of my deep love for nature. In life, when things donâ€™t work out, I rely on time, prayer, and the assurance that I am doing my best.

**Favorite classes prior to joining UTK:**
- Machine Learning
- Information Visualization
- Data Engineering
- Image Processing

**About my Pet**

My favorite pet, Peace, passed away 15 years ago, and I still cherish her memory.
